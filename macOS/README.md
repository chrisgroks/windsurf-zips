# Windsurf Application Installation (macOS)

This guide explains how to unzip and install Windsurf applications on your macOS system.

## Prerequisites

-   A `.zip` file containing the Windsurf application.
-   macOS

## Installation Steps

1.  **Locate the ZIP file:** Find the downloaded `.zip` file (e.g., `WindsurfApp.zip`) in your `Downloads` folder or wherever you saved it.

2.  **Unzip the file:**
    *   Double-click the `.zip` file. macOS will automatically extract the contents into a new folder with the same name as the archive (minus the `.zip` extension).
    *   Alternatively, you can right-click (or Control-click) the `.zip` file and select "Open With" > "Archive Utility".

3.  **Move to Applications Folder:**
    *   Open the newly created folder. You should see an application file (e.g., `WindsurfApp.app`).
    *   Drag this application file (`.app`) to your `Applications` folder. You can find the `Applications` folder in the Finder sidebar or by navigating to `Go > Applications` from the Finder menu bar.

4.  **Launch the Application:**
    *   Open your `Applications` folder.
    *   Double-click the Windsurf application icon to launch it.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"App can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"**: 
    If you see this message, you may need to adjust your security settings or grant an exception for this specific app.
    1.  Open `System Settings` (or `System Preferences` on older macOS versions).
    2.  Go to `Privacy & Security` (or `Security & Privacy`).
    3.  Scroll down to the `Security` section.
    4.  You should see a message about the blocked app with an option to "Open Anyway". Click it.
    5.  You might be prompted to enter your administrator password.
*   **Corrupted ZIP file:** If the unzipping process fails, the downloaded `.zip` file might be corrupted. Try downloading it again.

That's it! Your Windsurf application should now be installed and ready to use.
